            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate and all the other aspects of the operation. Hence, the differentiation between government schools and private schools can be misleading.[22] However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: The Emptying of Public Schools and Growth of Private Schools in India, it is said that for sensible education-policy making, it is vital to take account of the various changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor policies/legislation, with adverse effects on children's education. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the Indian central government, and the state governments have responsibility for enacting and implementing education policy.[35] The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern of education.[36]: 3  In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Maharashtra) or Higher Secondary Schools(most other states),[36] : 44  and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree.[37] The first 10 years is further subdivided into 8 years of elementary education (5 years Primary School and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education followed by 2 years of Higher Secondary Schools or Junior colleges.</p>
